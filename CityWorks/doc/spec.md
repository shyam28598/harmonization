## Description

The Data Model is is a contextual description of urban works carried out on a road axis and which can impact individual (Cars, motorcycles, bicycles, .Â…) or common transport (Tram, Bus, subway).
It contains a geographic representation making it possible to locate its work from a specific JSON Object and at a more global level (Road segment, Road, District, ...) in order to assess the potential impacts on the circulation.

*Note about the relation with other Data Model:* 
The impacts on public transport (bus, metro, tram, schoolbus, etc.), schools, cultural or sporting events are taken into account in this data model.
In order to describe each impact, a structured value from 0 to N occurrences is proposed, where each element is a string in the format: `lineImpact`: [A list of segment impact with `Free Text` or `GeoProperty` or a reference to another entity `SegmentEntity`, separated by a comma]

*Note about the GeoJSON object :* 
It may represent a region of space (a Geometry), a spatially-bounded entity (a Feature), or a list of features (a Feature Collection). refer to the document [geojson](https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-ietf-geojson-03.pdf) for more information about the modelisation and the possible value.
